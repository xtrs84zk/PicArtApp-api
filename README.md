# PicArtApp-api
REST API for the PicArtApp project found on https://github.com/Agreedroom/PicArtApp 

## Getting Started
Basic SQL, Java and Spring knowledge.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
IntelliJ IDEA (preferably the Ultimate one)
Spring plugin
Java 1.8
Tested on MySQL 5.7.26 and 8.0.16
(MySQL server has to be already running ;)
```

### Installing

Clone the repository and open it on IntelliJ IDEA

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xtrs84zk/PicArtApp-api.git
```

After is imported, configure pom.xml and resources/applicaction.properties
If everything is alright, your Spring Api should be listening on the configured port.

## Running the tests

Just test it as any other Spring Api, some fetch here, some post there. Voila.
We did use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) for this step.
