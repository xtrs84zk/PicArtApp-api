# PicArtApp-api
REST API for the PicArtApp project found on https://github.com/Agreedroom/PicArtApp 

## Getting Started
Basic MySQL, Java and Spring knowledge.

### Prerequisites

There is some software needed.

```
IntelliJ IDEA (preferably the Ultimate one)
Spring plugin (I believe it's not needed if you use the Initializr)
Java 1.8
Tested on MySQL 5.7.26 and 8.0.16
(MySQL server has to be already running ;)
```

### Installing

Clone the repository and open it on IntelliJ IDEA

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xtrs84zk/PicArtApp-api.git
```

After is imported, configure pom.xml and resources/applicaction.properties.

If everything is alright, your Spring Api should be listening on the configured port.

## Running the tests

Just test it as any other Spring Api, some fetch here, some post there. Voila.


We did use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) for this step.
